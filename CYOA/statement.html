            <p>What interested me the most when reading the book was how frequently Malcolm X seemed to move locations, and how his new environments shaped his experiences and outlook. Visual and interactive materials have always been my most productive way of expressing and retaining information, and I wanted to see geographically how X’s story developed. Granted, I’m not the most talented artist, but I’ve been taking coding classes for the past few years at BHS and I wanted to see if I could apply those skills.

                <br><br>To complete this project, I researched both the autobiography and online sources like the National Register of Historic Places. The documentation of X’s physical life is solid, but his thoughts are especially well preserved in the book. Comparing his location with his sentiments regarding race doesn’t reveal any radical patterns, but it shows how he was able to find both opposition and inspiration all over the country. 
                
                <br><br>The project is in no way meant to be a comprehensive summary of the book, but a rough outline of X’s early life can be traced through the points on the map. By focusing on his physical location and his views at different points through his life, I was able to make some new connections I hadn’t made before. For example, after his time in prison, X returned to Michigan, the same state he spent a large portion of his childhood living in. His attitude regarding education and race relations in Lansing seemed to be resentful, and he was eager to leave. However, in his time in Detroit, he worked hard to reach out to young adults and improve the situation of others. Furthemore, a rather shallow assumption I would have made before reading is that the greatest levels of racism he endured would have predominantly been in Southern states. In reality, he faced extreme levels even in a Black neighborhood in New York, and his takeaways from Florida proved to be very inspirational. My understanding of the book’s greater context was also improved by mapping the plot. I was able to make connections to things we learned in history class, for example, how the Great Migration could have influenced the demographics of the different settings.
                
                <br><br>Given more time, I would make a few changes to both the information and the code. I’d like to find a way to expand the project beyond the context of the US and include what X learned on his hajj and trips to other countries. I would also polish the site to make it a little more user-friendly. I'm working on adding images to appear when the user hovers, but as it's 11pm on the night this project is due, maybe that's an addition for another day. I was grateful for the opportunity to learn about this type of coding. Small details, like when the color of an object changes when you hover over it, make a website much more engaging, and my goal is to make an interactive experience rather than something like a slide presentation.
