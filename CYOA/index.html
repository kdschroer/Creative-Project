                <h1>Harlem, NY</h1>
                <p>Malcom became enamored with the environment of Harlem through his job working on the train lines. He moved in and started work at a bar in 1943. 
                    He gradually became a master of Harlem's underworld scene. Hhe started gambling, using and selling drugs, and living a hustler's life. Malcom managed to successfully evade the WWII draft, but was promptly arrested for an unrelated crime.
                    He felt that his conviction had just as much to do with the fact he was around white women as the actual crimes he committed, highlighting the racial stereotypes and discrimination that were prominent in law at the time. 
                    He later returned to Harlem to do a great deal of faith- and race- related work, including the development of a Muslim temple and the Organization for Afro-American Unity. He was shot and killed in the Audubon Ballroom in 1965.

                <p>Malcom X, originally Malcolm Little, was born in Omaha on May 19, 1925. Malcom's father, Earl Little, was both a Baptist preacher and an outspoken supporter of activist Marcus Garvey.
                    Growing up in the city's predominantly Black community, he was given an early introduction to the realities of racial prejudice.

                <p>Upon their move to Lansing, Malcolm's family's house was burned down by white supremacists. His examination of the working world showed that even well-to-do Black individuals hold jobs like shoe-shining, and many were out of work.
